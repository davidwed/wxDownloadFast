wxDownload Fast
=====================================================================

Introduction
----------
This program was created with intention to substitute the existing
commercial downloads managers.  In this way I intend to add
the maximum of options in order to let the program the most complete
possible.

Characteristics of the Program 
------------------------------
* Allows to carry through download of some archives simultaneously,
  and allow to split the downloads in some lowered parts.
* Allows to organize the archive already downloaded
* Allows to continue one download interrupted of the point where had stopped
* The messages sended/received for the program when connecting to servers HTTP/FTP
* It can be translated with easiness for any language.  Being avaliable initially
in Portuguese[Brasil] and English
* Allows to connect in servers ftp which need password
* Generate the MD5 of the downloaded archives, facilitating the verification

Installation
------------

Win32
-----

- Installing from binary

Is available in the page of the program contends this program.  This archive is in
the form of a installation program.
To intall the program follow the wizard.
Then to change the Language from Portuguese to English to this:
1) Star the program
2) Go to menu "Ver->Idiomas"
3) Select "Inglês"
4) Press "OK"
5) Press "OK" again
6) Close the program
7) Restart the program and the interface will be in english

- Compiling code source

To build the program in the Windows it is necessary the MinGW and the
MSys[www.mingw.org ] that they are the compiler GCC for windows and an environment
unix respectively.  Moreover is necessary the library wxWidgets[www.wxwidgets.org ],
builded with the option: --enable-xrc.
Of ownership of the requisite ones above it is enough to enter where the code source
was unpacked and type:
# make BUILD=win32

With this, the executable will be generated, being enough after that to copy the
executable archive for a desired place, and to use it.

Linux
-----

- Compiling code source

To build the program in the Linux it is necessary the GCC and the program make.
Moreover is necessary the library wxWidgets[www.wxwidgets.org ],builded with
the option: --enable-xrc.  Of ownership of the requisite ones above it is enough
to enter where the code source was unpacked and type:
# make

With this, the executable will be generated, being enough after that to copy
the executable archive for a desired place, and to use it.  For this it types:
# su
# make install

MacOS
-----

- Compiling code source

As I never had access to a system running the MacOS, I never build the program
in this system, however I believe that the steps used in the Linux should work for
the MacOS
